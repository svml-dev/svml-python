    "context": "\n    In the modern workplace, collaboration between teams is essential for innovation, yet communication barriers often arise due to differing priorities, technical jargon, and organizational silos. \n    While leadership may emphasize agility and rapid iteration, compliance departments focus on risk mitigation and regulatory adherence, sometimes creating friction. \n    Meanwhile, the rise of remote work has introduced both flexibility and new challenges in maintaining team cohesion and knowledge transfer. \n    Informal networks and mentorship programs can bridge some gaps, but not all employees have equal access to these resources. \n    The interplay between technology adoption, employee well-being, and business outcomes is complex: new tools can boost productivity but also cause cognitive overload or resistance to change. \n    Ultimately, the success of an organization depends on its ability to harmonize these diverse elements, foster psychological safety, and adapt to evolving market demands.\n",

    "justifications": "## Justifications\n    - **Reason 1** - Core relationships and tensions (collaboration, innovation, barriers, leadership, compliance) are mapped explicitly using SVML relationship operators for semantic fidelity.\n    - **Reason 2** - Layered structure (L1-L4) reflects conceptual hierarchy and recursive dependencies, aligning attention to primary, secondary, and tertiary concept clusters.\n    - **Reason 3** - Attention modifiers and stabilization/priming operators focus processing on the most critical organizational success factors (psychological safety, harmonization, adaptation).\n    - **Reason 4** - All angle brackets and ampersands are properly XML-escaped as required by the output specification.\n    - **Reason 5** - Compression of context is balanced with fidelity, avoiding information loss while ensuring SVML code remains interpretable per 1.2.2 syntax."
