    "original_context": "In the modern workplace, collaboration between teams is essential for innovation, yet communication barriers often arise due to differing priorities, technical jargon, and organizational silos. While leadership may emphasize agility and rapid iteration, compliance departments focus on risk mitigation and regulatory adherence, sometimes creating friction. Meanwhile, the rise of remote work has introduced both flexibility and new challenges in maintaining team cohesion and knowledge transfer. Informal networks and mentorship programs can bridge some gaps, but not all employees have equal access to these resources. The interplay between technology adoption, employee well-being, and business outcomes is complex: new tools can boost productivity but also cause cognitive overload or resistance to change. Ultimately, the success of an organization depends on its ability to harmonize these diverse elements, foster psychological safety, and adapt to evolving market demands.",

    "analysis": "Hierarchical layering is introduced to distinguish foundational concepts (L1) from supporting or contextual elements (L2), clarifying conceptual levels. Grouping related concepts within layers enhances structural clarity. The cluster for 'new_challenges' now correctly separates 'team_cohesion' and 'knowledge_transfer' with a comma to ensure syntactic clarity. Relationships retain their original semantic meanings, with no loss of key links or concepts.",
    "improvements": "- Added layers (L1, L2) to improve hierarchical structure as per guidance priorities.<br>- Grouped core and related concepts explicitly to clarify their levels and roles.<br>- Corrected minor syntactic issue with concept separation.<br>- Enhanced domain anchor usage by explicitly labeling thematic clusters.<br>- Retained all core concepts and essential relationships, preserving semantic fidelity.<br>- Avoided added complexity by minimal but effective structural enhancement."
