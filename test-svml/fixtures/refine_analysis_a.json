    "analysis": "Hierarchical layering is introduced to distinguish foundational concepts (L1) from supporting or contextual elements (L2), clarifying conceptual levels. Grouping related concepts within layers enhances structural clarity. The cluster for 'new_challenges' now correctly separates 'team_cohesion' and 'knowledge_transfer' with a comma to ensure syntactic clarity. Relationships retain their original semantic meanings, with no loss of key links or concepts.",
    "improvements": "- Added layers (L1, L2) to improve hierarchical structure as per guidance priorities.<br>- Grouped core and related concepts explicitly to clarify their levels and roles.<br>- Corrected minor syntactic issue with concept separation.<br>- Enhanced domain anchor usage by explicitly labeling thematic clusters.<br>- Retained all core concepts and essential relationships, preserving semantic fidelity.<br>- Avoided added complexity by minimal but effective structural enhancement."
